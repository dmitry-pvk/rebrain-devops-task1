# Project Name: Intelligent Traffic Management System

## Description
This project aims to develop an intelligent traffic management system that uses machine learning algorithms to optimize traffic flow, reduce congestion, and improve safety. The system will use data from various sensors and cameras to analyze traffic patterns and make real-time decisions to manage traffic.

## Features
- Real-time traffic monitoring
- Predictive traffic analysis
- Automated traffic signal control
- Dynamic lane management
- Intelligent speed control
- Incident detection and response
- Emergency vehicle prioritization

## Installation
1. Clone the repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/).
2. Install the required dependencies by running npm install.
3. Set up the necessary hardware components such as cameras, sensors, and traffic signals.
4. Run the project using npm start.

## Usage
1. Access the system dashboard on a computer or mobile device.
2. Monitor real-time traffic data and analysis.
3. Make adjustments to traffic signal timing, lane management, and speed control as needed.
4. Receive alerts and notifications for incidents and emergency vehicle prioritization.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Please fork the repository and create a pull request.

## Traffic Data Table

| Data Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Vehicle Count | Number of vehicles passing through a specific location |
| Speed | Average speed of vehicles passing through a specific location |
| Lane Occupancy | Percentage of time a lane is occupied by a vehicle |
| Congestion Level | Level of traffic congestion based on vehicle count and speed |
| Incident Reports | Reports of accidents, breakdowns, or other incidents affecting traffic flow |

## Traffic Signal Timing Table

| Time of Day | Traffic Signal Timing |
| --- | --- |
| Morning Rush Hour | Longer green lights for major roads, shorter green lights for side streets |
| Mid-Day | Balanced timing for all directions |
| Afternoon Rush Hour | Longer green lights for major roads, shorter green lights for side streets |
| Evening | Balanced timing for all directions |
| Overnight | Longer green lights for less traveled roads, shorter green lights for major roads |

## Emergency Vehicle Prioritization Table

| Priority Level | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Level 1 | Immediate response required, all traffic must yield to emergency vehicle |
| Level 2 | Urgent response required, traffic on major roads must yield to emergency vehicle |
| Level 3 | Non-urgent response required, emergency vehicle given priority at traffic signals and intersections |

It interrupts our own story, interrupts our ability to have a thought or a daydream, to imagine something wonderful, because we're too busy bridging the walk from the cafeteria back to the office on the cell phone." - Steven Spielberg
